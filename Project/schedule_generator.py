    Based on a user's PHQ-9 depression screening score of {score}/27, which indicates '{severity}' depression, and their stated preferences, generate a supportive and realistic one-week self-care schedule.

    User Preferences: "{preferences}"

    The schedule should:
    - Be formatted as a markdown table with columns: Day, Morning, Afternoon, Evening.
    - Be gentle and not overwhelming. For higher scores, suggest very small, manageable tasks (e.g., "Step outside for 5 minutes" instead of "Go for a 1-hour run").
    - Incorporate activities related to the user's preferences.
    - Include a mix of activities for physical well-being (e.g., gentle stretching, short walk), mental well-being (e.g., 5-minute mindfulness, journaling), and simple pleasures (e.g., listening to a favorite song, drinking tea).
    - For scores above 14, gently weave in reminders to connect with a friend, family member, or a professional.
    - Start with an empathetic and encouraging opening sentence before the table.
